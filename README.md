## Usage

### Setting up the Parking Sensor System

- Hardware Setup:

    Mount the ultrasonic sensors on the rear bumper of the vehicle. Ensure they have a clear view of the area you want to monitor.
    Connect the sensors to the Arduino Uno as per the provided schematics.
    Make sure to provide power to the Arduino board.

- Software Setup:

    Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer if you haven't already.
    Uploading the Code:

    Open the Arduino IDE and load the Arduino source code provided in this repository.
    Select the appropriate Arduino board and port in the IDE.
    Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
    Using the Parking Sensor System

- Power On:

    Ensure that the parking sensor system is powered on and operational.
    Visual Feedback:

    Observe the LEDs on the system. They will provide visual feedback to indicate the proximity of obstacles:
    - Green LEDs: Obstacles are at a safe distance.
    - Yellow LEDs: The vehicle is getting closer to an obstacle.
    - Red LEDs: The vehicle is dangerously close to an obstacle.
    
- Audible Warning:

    Listen for the buzzer, which will produce a warning sound when the vehicle is dangerously near an obstacle.

- Parking Guidance:

    Use the visual and audible feedback to gauge your distance from obstacles while parking.
    Adjust your parking maneuvers based on the system's indications to avoid collisions
